            <p>As creator of your User
                ID, you are completely responsible for your identity and Lycosa Technologies&nbsp; will not tolerate
                offensive, obscene, or otherwise inappropriate user identities. If a User ID
                violates any part of these ToS, determined at the sole and absolute discretion
                of Lycosa support
                staff, we may immediately, temporarily, or permanently ban such User ID from
                the Lycosa or
                services, with or without notice or prior warning.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>3. Account Security</b></p>
            <p>You, as the registered user
                of an Account, are ultimately and completely responsible for maintaining

                any time or allow anyone else to access the account. Sharing, trading,

                contacting us about an account issue.</p>
            <p>When creating a User ID,
                you agree to indemnify and hold Lycosa Technologies and
                its affiliates harmless for any improper use of such identity including, but

                your password in any way. Lycosa Technologies&nbsp; is not responsible for

                think before they click and engage in safe internet practices at all times.</p>

                applicable laws and also basic rules of etiquette, common courtesy, and common
                sense when using the Lycosa. Any conduct that violates the law in an
                offline, real world community is also a violation of these ToS. Lycosa Technologies&nbsp; will not tolerate any
                illegal conduct and will cooperate with law enforcement for such behavior.</p>
            <p>Lycosa Technologies&nbsp; may take any actions and
                impose any penalties we deem necessary to discourage and punish any violation
                of these ToS or any other illegal or inappropriate conduct, all without prior
                notice or warning. The determinations as to whether a violation has occurred
                and who is responsible for such act are solely within Lycosa’s discretion,
                and are based on what we deem best for the community. By using the Lycosa, you agree that you will be bound by Juan Calderón Alonso‘s determination
                as to whether a violation has occurred and any penalty we choose to implement.</p>

                experiences, and tolerance thresholds. The Rules of Conduct (hereinafter
